# curated-adblock-lists

Curated adblock lists for use in [uBlock Origin](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/) or AdGuard browser extensions.

I recommend that these lists are used in the [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) browser with the [uBlock Origin](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/) addon installed for full functionality.

I also test this list in the **Brave** browser with the **AdGuard** or the **uBlock Origin** browser extensions.

- Version: 1.0.1.4

I've created these lists to improve and cleanup sites I visit frequently. More filters will be added during 2025, the lists will avoid heavy filters that have a performance impact.

# Usage

To use these lists copy and paste any list you want from below.

For uBlock Origin: On the `Filter lists` tab, paste it into the `Import..` section and then press the `Apply changes` button at the top left of the page.
